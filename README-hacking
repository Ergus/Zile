Building from git
-----------------

Extra prerequisites: see “Build prerequisites” at the start of
`bootstrap.conf'; also recent gnulib (at time of reading!). The
bootstrap script will also complain if it can't find the tools it
needs, and tell you where to fetch the sources.

Check out Zile and bootstrap the build system:

        git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/zile.git
        ./bootstrap

Then follow the instructions for building from a release tarball (see
INSTALL).


Automated releases
------------------

To make a release automatically, you need ncftp, and woger, from
