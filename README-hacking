Building from git
-----------------

Extra prerequisites: see “Build prerequisites” at the end of
build-aux/bootstrap.conf; also recent gnulib (at time of reading!),
help2man.

Check out Zile and bootstrap the build system:

        git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/zile.git
        build-aux/bootstrap

Then follow the instructions for building from a release tarball (see
INSTALL).


Automated releases
------------------

To make a release automatically, you need ncftp, and woger, from
http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/woger
