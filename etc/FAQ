1. General questions

1.1. What does `Zile' mean?

    It stands for `Zile Is Lossy Emacs'. It is just another recursive
    acronym like GNU.

1.2. What is the Zile license?

    Zile is released under the GNU General Public License. For more
    information, see http://www.gnu.org/.

1.3. Why another clone of Emacs?  Why not just use Emacs?

    From the features list in the Info documentation:

	``Small but fast and powerful. It is very useful for small
	footprint installations (like on floppy disk) or quick editing
	sessions.''

    That's why sometimes (X)Emacs isn't the best editor to use :-) I
    use XEmacs myself when I do coding, but I use Zile when I have,
    let's say, to quick edit the dot files in the home directory; I
    don't want to wait 5 seconds to load XEmacs for doing a 2 seconds
    editing...

1.4. Why did you choose such difficult key sequences?

    To be the same as Emacs.

1.5. Zile has a bug!

    Bug reports can be sent to the developers at
    <zile-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>, or entered directly into
    Bugzilla at http://sourceforge.net/projects/zile. Patches are
    appreciated.

1.6. I like the xyz function of (X)Emacs but it's not in Zile!

    Zile was written to be small but fast and powerful enough.

    In general, if you need something more powerful, use Emacs or
    XEmacs. You could also try Jed, which emulates Emacs, is not much
    bigger than Zile, and has syntax highlighting, a macro language
    and more (http://www.jedsoft.org/jed/).

    If you still think that a certain function should be implemented
    in Zile, please send a message to the developers (see question
    1.5).

1.7. How small does Zile get?

    On Fedora Core 1/i386, Zile 1.7 built with gcc 3.3.2 -O2 weighs in
    at 92,206 bytes when stripped. This is how Zile will typically be
    built.

1.8. Does Zile support the Unicode / UTF-8 encodings?

   Currently Zile doesn't include any code for Unicode support. A
   major rewrite of the editor with ad-hoc support for multibyte
   sequences is planned in the future.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Functionality

2.1. How to quit Zile?

    Type `C-x C-c' (that means holding CONTROL while typing X,
    releasing them, then holding CONTROL while typing C)

2.2. How to return to the shell without leaving Zile?

    Type `C-x C-z' or simply `C-z'.

2.3. Zile is hung.

    From the tutorial (`C-h t'):

    If Zile gets into an infinite (or simply very long) computation
    which you don't want to finish, you can stop it safely by typing
    `C-g'. You can also use `C-g' to discard a numeric argument or the
    beginning of a command that you don't want to finish.

2.4. How to undo the previous command?

    Type `C-x u'.

2.5. What does `C-something' or `M-something' mean?

    From the tutorial (`C-h t'):

    C-<chr> means hold the CONTROL key while typing the character
	     <chr> Thus, `C-f' would be: hold the CONTROL key and type
	     `f'.
    M-<chr> means hold the META or EDIT or ALT key down while typing
	     <chr>. If there is no META, EDIT or ALT key, instead
	     press and release the ESC key and then type <chr>. We
	     write <ESC> for the ESC key.

2.6. The colors are not displayed on my screen.

    Enable the `colors' variable into your `~/.zilerc' file. If it is
    already enabled, check your `TERM' environment variable and the
    ncurses manual.

    If you are using Zile under xterm, you might need to set the
    `TERM' variable to `xterm-color' or something like.

2.7. What are the available variables that can be modified?

    Check out the `zilerc.sample' file (type `C-h s') for a full list
    of modifiable variables.

    You might also see the list of defined variables with the command
    `list-variables' (or the key sequence `C-h l v').

2.8. How to display non-English characters?

    Put the following line in your `~/.zilerc' file:

    	displayable-characters = "0x20-0x7e,0xa1-0xff"

2.9. Zile doesn't handle filenames with non-English characters.

    Try to set the LANG environment variable according to your locale,
    before running Zile. For example, for a French environment, try:

	export LANG=fr_FR	(with a Bourne-like shell)

	setenv LANG fr_FR	(with a C-like shell).

2.10. The `C-h' key is bound to <BS>/<DEL>; help doesn't work.

    You might try adding the following line to your `~/.zilerc' file:

	alternative-bindings = true

    and using the alternative key sequences (`M-h' instead of `C-h').

2.11. How to change the binding of a function?

    Unfortunately no run-time option exists, yet. If you would like to
    change a key binding of Zile, you have to edit the
    `src/tbl_funcs.h' file and recompile the sources.

2.13. The Zile screen is not resized in a X Window terminal.

    There are two possibilities:

    (1) Your terminal application does not send the signal `SIGWINCH'
        to Zile (and other applications). To be sure, you might check
        if also other text-mode applications, like `vim' and `joe', do
        not resize their windows.

    (2) Your ncurses library does not support the `KEY_RESIZE' pseudo
        key. This is because your version is old or was not compiled
        with the flag `--enable-sigwinch' to `configure'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Compiling

3.1. Can I compile Zile with the old Berkeley curses?

    No, you can't. The 4.4BSD or prior versions of curses are
    obsolete. Zile supports only ncurses (tested with version 5.3).

3.2. Zile doesn't compile correctly under the Foobar operating system.

    We have tested Zile under Linux only. Since it is written in ANSI
    C, should be fairly easy to port it under other UNIX-like
    operating systems. If you get Zile running under some other OS,
    please send a message to the Zile developers telling them that
    (you might send him the patches you have made to the Zile sources
    if you want them included in the next release).

    Zile is also known to work under the following operating systems:

	* FreeBSD
	* NetBSD
	* OpenBSD
	* Solaris
	* Windows with Cygwin

3.3. Can I compile Zile under Cygwin?

    Yes, you can. You might need to put a

	#include <getopt.h>

    line in the `etc/mkdoc.c' and `src/main.c' files, if the compiler
    complains about the `getopt' function prototype and/or the
    `optarg' variable.
