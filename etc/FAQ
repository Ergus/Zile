1. General questions

1.1. What does `Zile' mean?

    It stands for `Zile Is Lossy Emacs'.  It is just another recursive
    achronim like GNU (GNU's Not Unix).

1.2. How to quit Zile?

    Type `C-x C-c' (that means holding CONTROL while typing X, releasing them,
    then holding CONTROL while typing C)

1.3. How to return to the shell without leaving Zile?

    Type `C-x C-z' or simply `C-z'.

1.4. Zile is hung.

    From the tutorial (`C-h t'):
    If Zile gets into an infinite (or simply very long) computation which
    you don't want to finish, you can stop it safely by typing `C-g'.
    You can also use `C-g' to discard a numeric argument or the beginning of
    a command that you don't want to finish.

1.5. How to undo the previous command?

    Type `C-x u'.

1.6. What does `C-something' or `M-something' mean?

    From the tutorial (`C-h t'):
    C-<chr>  means hold the CONTROL key while typing the character <chr>
	     Thus, `C-f' would be: hold the CONTROL key and type `f'.
    M-<chr>  means hold the META or EDIT or ALT key down while typing <chr>.
	     If there is no META, EDIT or ALT key, instead press and release
	     the ESC key and then type <chr>.  We write <ESC> for the ESC key.

1.7. Is Zile GNU GPL copylefted?

    No it isn't.  It is released under a Berkeley-style license.
    For more information read the `COPYRIGHT' file.

1.8. The colors are not displayed on my screen.

    Enable the `colors' variable into your `~/.zilerc' file.  If it is already
    enabled, check your `TERM' environment variable and the ncurses manual.

1.9. What are the available variables that can be modified?

    Check out the `zilerc.sample' file (type `C-h s') for a full list
    of modifiable variables.
    You might also see the list of defined variables with the
    command `list-variables' (or the key sequence `C-h l v').

1.10. Zile resets the fontlock on every `C-l' press.

    Disable the `auto-font-lock-refresh' variable in your `~/.zilerc'
    initialization file.

1.11. How to display non-English characters?

    Put the following line in your `~/.zilerc' file:

    	displayable-characters = "0x20-0x7e,0xa1-0xff"

1.12. The `C-h' key is bound to <BS>/<DEL>; help doesn't work.

    You might try adding the following line to your `~/.zilerc' file:

	alternative-bindings = true

    and using the alternative key sequences (`M-h' instead of `C-h').

1.13. How to enable Auto Fill Mode in Text Mode at startup?

    Add the following line to your `~/.zilerc' file:

	text-mode-auto-fill = true

2. Functionality

2.1. Zile is bogus.

    Any bug reports should be sent to the author at the Internet email
    address <ssigala@tiscalinet.it>.  Patches are appreciated.

2.2. I like the xyz function of (X)Emacs but in Zile isn't implemented.

    Zile was written to be small but fast and powerful enough.
    The most important thing is to be useful for small footprint
    installations (like on floppy disk) or quick editing sessions.
    In general, if you need something more powerful, use Emacs or XEmacs.
    If you still think that a certain function should be implemented
    in Zile, please send a message to the author (see previous question).

2.3. Why did you choose such difficult key sequences?

    Ask rms@gnu.org.

2.4. What is the Zile internal macro language?

    Zile is written in C only.  It doesn't currently support any macro
    language like Lisp under Emacs or SLang under Jed.

2.5. What about a GUI version of Zile?

    See question 2.3.

2.6. Why another clone of Emacs?  Why not just use Emacs?

    From the features list in the Info documentation:
	``Small but fast and powerful.  It is very useful for small
	footprint installations (like on floppy disk) or quick editing
	sessions.''

    That's why sometimes (X)Emacs isn't the best editor to use :-)
    I use XEmacs myself when I do coding, but I use Zile when I have,
    let's say, to quick edit the dot files in the home directory; I don't
    want to wait 5 seconds to load XEmacs for doing a 2 seconds editing...

3. Compiling

3.1. Can I compile Zile with the old Berkeley curses?

    No, you can't.  The 4.4BSD or prior versions of curses are obsolete.
    Zile supports only ncurses (tested with version 4.2).

3.2. Zile doesn't compile correctly under the Foobar operating system.

    I have tested Zile under SuSE Linux 6.1 only.  Since it is
    written in ANSI C, should be fairly easy to port it under other UNIX-like
    operating systems.  If you get Zile running under any other OS, please
    send a message to the Zile author telling him that (you might send him
    the patches you done to the Zile sources if you want them included in the
    next release).
