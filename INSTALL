               Zile build and installation instructions
               ----------------------------------------

To build and install Zile:

[Only if you're compiling the CVS sources, first make sure you have
the GNU autotools installed (automake >= 1.9, autoconf >= 2.59) and
run

        autoreconf -i
]

1) Run configure:

	./configure

2) Compile the sources:

	make

3) To install Zile, run

	make install

   By default, Zile is installed under /usr/local; this can be changed
   by using the --prefix argument to configure, e.g.

	./configure --prefix=$HOME/zile

   You can also run it in place (src/zile), but if you do that the
   built-in documentation won't be available.


Options
-------

If you are debugging the editor, you can enable the debugging code:

  --enable-debug          include debugging code and assertions

For other configure options, run

	./configure --help


Automated releases
------------------

To make a release automatically, you need woger, from
