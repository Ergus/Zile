               Zile build and installation instructions
               ----------------------------------------

Special note for Cygwin users: If you are trying compiling Zile with
cygwin, please read question 3.3 of the FAQ (found in the `etc'
subdirectory).


To build zile:

1) Run configure:

	./configure

2) Compile the sources:

	make

3a) To install zile, run

	make install

   By default, zile is installed under /usr/local; this can be changed
   by using the --prefix argument to configure.

3b) If you just want to try zile, edit the `src/paths.h' file: replace
   the line

	#define PATH_DATA "/usr/local/share/zile"

   by

	#define PATH_DATA "/zile_src_dir/etc/zile"

   where `zile_src_dir' is the absolute directory where you unpacked the
   Zile sources.

4b) Recompile the sources:

	make

5b) To try zile, run it: 

	src/zile


Options
-------

If you are debugging the editor, you can enable the debugging code:

  --enable-debug          include debugging code and assertions

For other configure options, run

	 ./configure --help


Changing key bindings
---------------------

If you would like to change some key bindings of Zile, you need to
edit the `src/tbl_funcs.h' file. Maybe in the future a feature for
rebinding a function at run-time will be available.
