               Zile build and installation instructions
               ----------------------------------------

Special note for Cygwin users: If you are trying compiling Zile with
cygwin, please read question 3.3 of the FAQ (found in the `etc'
subdirectory).


To build zile:

1) Run configure:

	./configure

2) Compile the sources:

	make

3a) To install zile, run

	make install

   By default, zile is installed under /usr/local; this can be changed
   by using the --prefix argument to configure.

3b) If you just want to try zile, edit the `src/paths.h' file: replace
   the line

	#define PATH_DATA "/usr/local/share/zile"

   by

	#define PATH_DATA "/zile_src_dir/etc/zile"

   where `zile_src_dir' is the absolute directory where you unpacked the
   Zile sources.

4b) Recompile the sources:

	make

5b) To try zile, run it: 

	src/zile


Editing modes and other options
-------------------------------

By default not all functions are enabled. By passing flags to
`configure', you can enable the omitted features.

The options are the following:

  --enable-c-mode         include C Mode
  --enable-cpp-mode       include C++ Mode
  --enable-shell-mode     include Shell Mode
  --enable-csharp-mode    include C# Mode
  --enable-java-mode      include Java Mode
  --enable-mail-mode      include Mail Mode
  --enable-all-modes      include all editing modes
  --enable-lua            Lua scripting (EXPERIMENTAL)

Text Mode is always enabled.

Lua scripting requires an installation of Lua 5, including header
files and libraries. It is currently experimental, and not recommended
for general use.

If you are debugging the editor, you can enable the debugging code:

  --enable-debug          include debugging code and assertions

For other configure options, run

	 ./configure --help


Changing key bindings
---------------------

If you would like to change some key bindings of Zile, you need to
edit the `src/tbl_funcs.h' file. Maybe in the future a feature for
rebinding a function at run-time will be available.
