To build and install Zile:

[Only if you're compiling the sources checked out from git, first make
sure you have the GNU autotools installed (automake >= 1.9, autoconf
>= 2.59), and a version of gnulib from 2008 or later, and run

        ./autogen.sh
]

1) Run configure:

        ./configure

2) Compile the sources:

        make

3) To install Zile, run

        make install

   By default, Zile is installed under /usr/local; this can be changed
   by using the --prefix argument to configure, e.g.

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/zile

   You can also run it in place (src/zile), but if you do that the
   built-in documentation won't be available.


Automated releases
