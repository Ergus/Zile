Building from a release tarball
-------------------------------

Prerequisites: (n)curses, help2man.

1) Run configure:

        ./configure

2) Compile the sources:

        make

3) To install Zile, run

        make install

   By default, Zile is installed under /usr/local; this can be changed
   by using the --prefix argument to configure, e.g.

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/zile


Building from the repository
----------------------------

Prerequisites: automake >= 1.9, autoconf >= 2.59, gnulib from 2008 or
later.

Check out Zile and bootstrap the build system:

        git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/zile.git
        ./autogen.sh

Then follow the instructions for building from a release tarball.


Automated releases
