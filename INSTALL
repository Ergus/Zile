             GNU Zile build and installation instructions
             --------------------------------------------

Building from a release tarball
-------------------------------

Prerequisites: (n)curses, Perl. If you wish to use a non-standard
library name, this can be specified using CURSES_LIB, and CPPFLAGS can
be used for non-standard include paths. For example, to use the X
version of PDcurses:

CPPFLAGS=/usr/local/include/xcurses CURSES_LIB=-lXCurses ./configure

1) Run configure:

        ./configure

2) Compile the sources:

        make

3) To install Zile, run

        make install

   By default, Zile is installed under /usr/local; this can be changed
   by using the --prefix argument to configure, e.g.

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/zile


Building from the repository
----------------------------

Extra prerequisites: automake >= 1.9, autoconf >= 2.59, recent gnulib
(at time of reading!), help2man.

Check out Zile and bootstrap the build system:

        git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/zile.git
        ./autogen.sh

Then follow the instructions for building from a release tarball.


Automated releases
------------------

To make a release automatically, you need ncftp, and woger, from
http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/woger
