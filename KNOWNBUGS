* The `switch-to-buffer' algorithm is not exactly equal to Emacs (the sequence
  of buffers is not the same).

* The method of resolving the `C-h' problem by replacing it with `M-h' is not
  a ``Good Thing''(TM).

* There are many statically allocated buffers that may overflow in the
  near future.

* The background colors are not handled very well under X Window terminals.

* The macros do not work for interactive commands.

* Font Lock in Shell Mode isn't perfect; Shell scripts can be very
  complicated to parse.

* Font lock in C/C++ Mode lacks correct support for floats
  (e.g: 1.-e3.4e5 is recognized as a number).
