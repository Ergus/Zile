* Insertion of large chunks of text with `insert-buffer',
  `insert-file' or `insert-register' can be very slow with Font Lock
  Mode enabled. Undoing insertions of binary files can be very slow
  too.

* The method of resolving the `C-h' problem by replacing it with `M-h'
  is not a ``Good Thing''(TM).

* The macros do not work for interactive commands.

* Font Lock in Shell Mode isn't perfect; Shell scripts can be very
  complicated to parse. Example:

	echo This is a \'$string\'

* Font lock in C/C++ Mode lacks correct support for floats (e.g:
  1.-e3.4e5 is recognized as a number).

* Line wrapping should happen on Return, not just Space.
