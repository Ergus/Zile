Making a release
----------------

To make a release automatically, you need ncftp, and woger, from
http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/woger

Here are the steps we (maintainers) follow when making a release.

* Ensure that acceptable versions of autoconf, automake, etc.
  are in your PATH.  See the buildreq list in bootstrap.conf for
  the complete list of tools.

* Start from a clean, up-to-date git directory on the branch you want
  to release from, ensure that you have no uncommitted diffs, have
  pushed all changes that belong in the release, and that all tests
  pass:

    make prerelease

  (Make sure you have any needed Valgrind suppressions files.)

* Check that the NixOS/Hydra autobuilder is reporting all is well:

    http://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/gnu/zile-master

* To (i) set the date, version number, and release TYPE on line 3 of
  NEWS, (ii) commit that, and (iii) tag the release, run

    # "TYPE" must be stable, beta or alpha
    make release-commit RELEASE='X.Y TYPE'

* Run the following to create release tarballs.  Your choice selects the
  corresponding upload-to destination in the emitted gnupload command.
  The different destinations are specified in cfg.mk.  See the definitions
  of gnu_ftp_host-{alpha,beta,stable}.

    make release RELEASE='X.Y TYPE'

* Write the release announcement that you will soon post.  Start with
  the template, $HOME/announce-zile-X.Y that was just created by
  that "make" command.

Once all the builds and tests have passed,

* Run:

    make dorelease
