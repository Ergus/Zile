The authors of Zile:

* Sandro Sigala <sandro@sigala.it> conceived and wrote Zile
  single-handed up to version 1.6.1.

* Scott Lawrence <yorgle@gmail.com> wrote the "lithp" interpreter
  which was used as the basis for the tiny Lisp interpreter in C Zile.

* Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org> maintained C Zile from version 1.6.1,
  to version 2.4.9, and translated the code from C that formed the
  foundation of Lua Zile.

* David A. Capello <dacap@users.sourceforge.net> contributed to Zile
  from version 1.7 to 2.0, adding many new features such as regex
  search.

* Gary V. Vaughan <gary@gnu.org> began work on Lua Zile just before
  C Zile 2.4.0 was released; took over maintenance as C Zile was
  moth-balled after 2.4.9; and moved Lua Zile into the new "Zile
  Implements Lua Editors" era.
