The authors of Zile:

* Sandro Sigala <sandro@sigala.it> conceived and wrote Zile
  single-handed up to version 1.6.1.

* Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org> joined the project at version 1.6.1,
  and has been responsible for maintenance and releases since then,
  fixing bugs and adding a few features along the way, and translated
  Zile into Lua.

* David A. Capello <dacap@users.sourceforge.net> contributed to Zile
  from version 1.7 to 2.0, adding many new features such as regex
  search.

* Scott Lawrence <yorgle@gmail.com> wrote the "lithp" interpreter
  which was used as the basis for the tiny Lisp interpreter.

* Gary V. Vaughan <gary@gnu.org> made the build system non-recursive
  and did a lot of work on the Lua version.
