HIGH PRIORITY

* Functions/bindings to implement:

To implement and document the following functions (dummy functions
already exist):

X1("backward-sentence", backward_sentence,		"M-a")
X1("forward-sentence", forward_sentence,		"M-e")
X1("kill-sentence", kill_sentence,			"M-k")
X1("backward-kill-sentence", backward_kill_sentence,	"C-x\\DEL")
X1("backward-paragraph", backward_paragraph,		"M-[")
X1("forward-paragraph", forward_paragraph,		"M-]")
X1("mark-paragraph", mark_paragraph,			"M-h")
X1("fill-paragraph", fill_paragraph,			"M-q")

* Complete universal-argument functionality for:

transpose-chars
transpose-words
transpose-sexps
transpose-lines

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOW PRIORITY

X1("kill-rectangle", kill_rectangle,			"C-xrk")

* Make query & replace case friendly, e.g., if you specify to replace
  `foo' with `bar', the string
	"foo Foo FOO"
  should be replaced with
	"bar Bar BAR"

* Josef 'Jupp' Schugt <jupp@gmx.de>:
  - Mail Mode:
	* Replace "*emphasis*" and "_emphasis_" by " emphasis " where the
	  former is rendered bold and the latter underscored.
	* Signatures support.
  - Small HTML support: during saving HTML files, change
		<!-- hhmts start -->
		<!-- hhmts end -->
	to:
		<!-- hhmts start -->
		Last modified: Mon Apr  1 20:17:57 UTC 2002
		<!-- hhmts end -->
	If the "Last modified:" line is already present, it is updated.
* Paragraph formatting.
* Allow the user to modify/define key bindings.
* Regex pattern patching for search/replace functions.
* Automatic indentation for C/C++ modes.
* Reimplement syntax highlighting using regex pattern matching.
* Parser for `-*- C -*-' and `-*- C++ -*-' like headers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERY LOW PRIORITY (may require a rewrite)

* Use a kernel of editing functions for low level editing; all other
  high level functions should call these functions to access the data.
* Buffer oriented structures vs. line oriented structures (like now).
* Unicode support.
* Mouse support.
