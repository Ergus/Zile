(Anything urgent should be filed as a bug)


MEDIUM PRIORITY

* Complete universal-argument functionality for:

transpose-chars
transpose-words
transpose-sexps
transpose-lines

* Functions/bindings to implement and document (dummy functions
  already exist):

X1("backward-sentence", backward_sentence,              "M-a")
X1("forward-sentence", forward_sentence,                "M-e")
X1("kill-sentence", kill_sentence,                      "M-k")
X1("backward-kill-sentence", backward_kill_sentence,    "C-x\\DEL")
X1("name-last-kbd-macro", name_last_kbd_macro,          "")

* Add function key support to termcap, and remove code for keys that
  cannot be supported.
* Allow search and replace not to follow case (case-fold-search,
  case-replace).
* Regex pattern matching for replace functions.
* Add undo compaction, so that functions implemented in terms of other
  functions can have a single undo action.
* Add Unicode support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOW PRIORITY (may require a rewrite)

* Use a kernel of editing functions for low level editing; all other
  high level functions should call these functions to access the data.
* Use buffer oriented structures rather than line oriented structures.
* Add mouse support.
* Speed up insertion of binary files.
* Find a better method of resolving the `C-h'/`M-h' problem.
* Make macros work for interactive commands.
