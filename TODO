HIGH PRIORITY

* BUGFIX: move code to deal with ~/ and ~user from expand_path to
  default_completion_reread (and factor out into a separate function).

* Functions/bindings to implement and document (dummy functions
  already exist):

X1("backward-sentence", backward_sentence,              "M-a")
X1("forward-sentence", forward_sentence,                "M-e")
X1("kill-sentence", kill_sentence,                      "M-k")
X1("backward-kill-sentence", backward_kill_sentence,    "C-x\\DEL")
X1("backward-paragraph", backward_paragraph,            "M-{")
X1("forward-paragraph", forward_paragraph,              "M-}")
X1("mark-paragraph", mark_paragraph,                    "M-h")
X1("fill-paragraph", fill_paragraph,                    "M-q")
X1("name-last-kbd-macro", name_last_kbd_macro,          "")

* Complete universal-argument functionality for:

transpose-chars
transpose-words
transpose-sexps
transpose-lines

* Strip binary during make install.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MEDIUM PRIORITY

* Functions/bindings to implement and document (dummy functions
  already exist):

X1("kill-rectangle", kill_rectangle,                    "C-xrk")

* Allow search and replace not to follow case (case-fold-search, case-replace)
* Regex pattern matching for replace functions.
* Unicode support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOW PRIORITY (may require a rewrite)

* Use a kernel of editing functions for low level editing; all other
  high level functions should call these functions to access the data.
* Buffer oriented structures vs. line oriented structures (like now).
* Mouse support.
* Undoing insertions of binary files can be very slow.
* The method of resolving the `C-h' problem by replacing it with `M-h'
  is not a ``Good Thing''(TM).
* The macros do not work for interactive commands.
