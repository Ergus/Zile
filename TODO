HIGH PRIORITY

* Functions/bindings to implement:

C-s, C-r	isearch-forward
C-r		isearch-backward
		replace-string
		query-replace
C-x r k		kill-rectangle
C-t		transpose-chars
M-t		transpose-words
C-M-t		transpose-sexps
C-x C-t		transpose-lines
M-DEL		backward-kill-word
C-x DEL		backward-kill-sentence
M-f		forward-word
M-b		backward-word
M-d		kill-word
		goto-char

* overwrite-mode: support the following Emacs functionality:
In overwrite mode, printing characters typed in replace existing text
on a one-for-one basis, rather than pushing it to the right.  At the
end of a line, such characters extend the line.  Before a tab,
such characters insert until the tab is filled in.
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C-q still inserts characters in overwrite mode; this
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
is supposed to make it easier to insert characters when necessary.

LOW PRIORITY

* Allow the user to modify/define key bindings.
* Regex pattern patching for search/replace functions.
* Syntax highlighting for shell mode.
* Automatic indentation for C/C++ modes.
* Reimplement syntax highlighting using regex pattern matching.
* Mouse support.
* Dialogs are more user friendly than the minibuf buffer.

* `*Messages Buffer*' feature.
  zilerc.sample entry:
    # Enable `*Messages*' buffer [default: yes]
    # If enabled, echo area informative messages are saved in an editor
    # buffer named `*Messages*'.  If you miss a message that appears briefly
    # on the screen, you can switch to the `*Messages*' buffer to see it again.
    messages-buffer = true

* Parser for `-*- C -*-' and `-*- C++ -*-' like headers.
