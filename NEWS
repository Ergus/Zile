Changes from Zile 1.6.1 - Zile 1.6.2

* Fixed a few core dumps.
* Fixed some bugs with patches from Nicolas Duboc.
* Fixed a build problem where dumb makes tried to build "-lncurses".

Changes between Zile 1.6 - Zile 1.6.1

* Added `.m' extension to C Mode (for Objective-C files).
* Fixed window resize bug under xterm (\377 character was inserted).
* Typos and minor bug fixes.

Changes between Zile 1.5.3 - Zile 1.6

* Implemented incremental search (`isearch-forward', `isearch-backward').
* Implemented search & replace (`replace-string', `query-replace').
* Implemented shell commands (`shell-command', `shell-command-on-region').
* Implemented better handling of unexpected errors, with automatic file
  saving on Zile crash.

Changes between Zile 1.5.2 - Zile 1.5.3

* Fixed wrong behavior in novice mode (Font Lock automatically set).
* Fixed a few core dumps.

Changes between Zile 1.5.1 - Zile 1.5.2

* Implemented Shell-script Mode.
* Fixed Solaris compatibility bugs.
* Fixed bugs in C/C++ Font Lock parsing.

Changes between Zile 1.5 - Zile 1.5.1

* Fixed Minibuf filename completion bug.

Changes between Zile 1.4 - Zile 1.5

* Added `switch-to-correlated-buffer' (bound to `F11').
* Added `skip-splash-screen' variable.
* Extented Mini Help functionality; now there are three help pages.
* Reorganized partially the `F1'..`F12' keys.
* Added a reference card (see `etc/refcard.tex' and `etc/refcard.ps').
* User-invisible changes: introduced three new general-purpose libraries:
	- lib/alist.c	Doubly-linked lists
	- lib/astr.c	Dynamically allocated strings
	- lib/htable.c	Hash table functions (was hash.c)
  The new libraries are documented in their man pages (see lib/*.3).
  Starting from this version, the internal structures will be rewritten
  using these libraries.  This will make the code easier to maintain,
  and hopefully fixes some hidden bugs.
* Many bug fixes.

Changes between Zile 1.3 - Zile 1.4

* Added support for `F1'..`F12' keys.
* Implemented the following functions:
	tabify
	untabify

* Added `text-mode-auto-fill' variable that automatically turns on the
  Auto Fill Mode in Text Mode.
* Now `set-variable' suggests the possibile variable values.

  at Zile startup.
* Bug fixes.

  Carsten Leonhardt <leo@debian.org>.

  Tim Middelkoop <mtim@arranvale.com>.
* Added `describe-function' (C-h d), `describe-variable' (C-h v) and
  `describe-key' (C-h k).  Now the program is really self-documenting!
* Added `list-bindings' (C-h l b), `list-functions' (C-h l f) and
  `list-registers' (C-h l r).
* Now the search functions remember the last searched value.
* All the help functions bound to `M-h' are now bound to `C-h' like Emacs.
* Added a lot of minor but useful features.

WARNING: the file backup variable `backup-files' has been renamed to
`backup-method' and the behavior has changed.  Please take a look at the
sample initialization file (press `C-h s').
