* Noteworthy changes in release 2.4.0.60 (2011-08-19) [beta]

  This release is a major update, upping the dependencies from C89 to
  C99, from POSIX-1.2001 to POSIX-1.2008 (though in fact Zile will
  still build on many other POSIX and non-POSIX systems thanks to
  gnulib), and adding a dependency on libgc. Together these changes
  have allowed the removal of hundreds of lines of code and the
  elimination of whole classes of bug (in particular, classic
  memory-management bugs); overall, combined with continued
  simplification, Zile 2.4.0.60 is well over 1,000 lines of code, or
  10%, shorter than the previous stable release, 2.3.24.

  Several old bugs have been fixed, a few more esoteric features
  removed, and Emacs-compliance has been improved. However, the major
  rewrite has almost certainly introduced new bugs which have not yet
  been found and fixed, hence the alpha status of this release.
  Distribution packagers are encouraged to try packaging this version
  to find any problems with the updated build system and dependencies.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.3.24 (2011-04-29) [stable]

** Bug fixes

  Fix kill-line with prefix argument.

  Fix a cosmetic problem with multiple ESC-digit combinations.

  Use gnulib’s mkstemp to avoid problems on some platforms.

  Fix initial screen setup when some files are loaded on the command
  line.

** Build-related

  Re-automate a bit more of the release, using gnulib and woger.

  Add more compiler warnings.

** Miscellaneous

  As usual, various bits of code cleanup and simplification.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.3.23 (2011-03-14) [stable]

** Bug fixes

  {beginning,end}-of-buffer now take account of transient-mark-mode
  (bug present since “forever”).

** Build-related

  Turn on more compiler and build system, and run-time checks (thanks,
  gnulib!).

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.3.22 (2011-03-03)

This release fixes a bug in forward regex isearch introduced recently,
and makes the build system use silent rules by default.

Release 2.3.21

This release fixes a bug that caused build failure on non-GNU systems,
and a bug in backward search introduced in 2.3.18, and simplifies the
test system. A little other code cleanup was done.

Release 2.3.20

This release fixes a potential buffer overflow, search and replace
with embedded NULs, a bug in the build system (the Zile-only tests now
run correctly when an EMACS environment variable is defined), and a
bug introduced in 2.3.17 which caused consecutive kills not to save
the killed text (thanks to Chris Leyon for the report). Some code was
cleaned up and better use made of gnulib. The build scripts that were
previously in Lua have been rewritten in Perl; Perl is now required to
build Zile (previously, Lua was not required, at the expense of making
the build system more complicated and fragile). A cyclomatic
complexity report on the C code can now be produced.

Release 2.3.19

This release fixes a space leak, a small bug in reading filenames in
the minibuffer introduced in 2.3.18, and some behaviour that was not
the same as Emacs, and cleans up the code a little.

Release 2.3.18

This release fixes some minor space leaks, a read of freed memory, and
a bug in quoted-insert, stops Zile from catching the user signal
SIGQUIT, and cleans the code up a little.

Release 2.3.17

This release fixes a crash in undo introduced in 2.3.16 as well as
some small bugs in delete-window, and contains some code cleanup.

Release 2.3.16

This release fixes a potential buffer overrun, and a long-standing bug
in the handling of the key string "C-_", and cleans up the code a
little more.

Release 2.3.15

This release fixes the default universal argument, which should be 4
but was 16, and also some cosmetic errors with the display of
universal arguments in the minibuffer. Some fixes to the build system
were also made (thanks to Giuseppe Scrivano).

Release 2.3.14

This release fixes a minor bug in filename tab expansion, which
resulted in `/' being expanded to `~/'.

Release 2.3.13

This release fixes bugs in `kill-line`, `scroll-up' and `scroll-down',
squashes some space leaks found by Valgrind, and fixes some build
problems reported by the indefatigable Nelson Beebe.

Release 2.3.12

This release fixes the +LINE command-line action, which was broken a
few releases ago, and makes a cosmetic fix to temporary buffers.

Release 2.3.11

This release fixes a crash in `find-alternate-file', a build system
bug, and various cosmetic bugs, and cleans up the code a little.

Release 2.3.10

This release runs the test suite on Emacs as well as Zile (currently,
requires Emacs 23 or later), and contains many small fixes to both the
test suite and to Zile to improve Emacs compatibility. Various other
bug fixes, improvements and tidy-ups have also been made. Note in
particular that the commands `suspend-zile', `save-buffers-kill-zile'
and `view-zile-FAQ' are now called `suspend-emacs',
`save-buffers-kill-emacs' and `view-emacs-FAQ' respectively, and
`kill-line' now works with non-positive arguments. Portability has
been improved, in particular to DOS systems.

Release 2.3.9

This release fixes a build problem on OSF/1.

Release 2.3.8

This release fixes a crash in find-file-alternate, and another
potential crash.

Release 2.3.7

This release fixes a crash in query-replace and a highlighting bug,
both introduced in 2.3.5. Some code cleanup was done. A bug in the
build system that caused help2man to be required to build Zile was
removed.

Release 2.3.6:

This release fixes a build-system bug that caused Lua to be required
to build the release.

Release 2.3.5:

This release fixes a bug in write-file, where the undo state was not
properly updated, resulting in dirty states being marked clean. A
crash bug in paragraph filling was fixed, and some other minor bugs.
The --funcall option was reintroduced for backwards compatibility with
Zile 2.2. The build system was made more portable. Some code cleanup
was done.

Release 2.3.4:

This release fixes yet another bug in filename completion, and a
potential crash that the bug exposed. Some minor code cleanup was
performed.

Release 2.3.3:

This release fixes two more bugs in filename completion introduced in
2.3.1. Users of 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 should upgrade. Some minor code
cleanup was also performed.

Release 2.3.2:

This release fixes a bug in filename completion introduced in the
previous release that had serious results, and some minor problems in
the build system, and improves the installation instructions. help2man
is now needed to build Zile (and has been since 2.3.1). I'm sorry I
described DejaGnu as "flaky" in my previous release announcement; the
faults I encountered were those of the underlying expect/Tcl
combination, and not DejaGnu's.

Release 2.3.1:

This release contains a rewrite of the test suite which drives Zile
directly, as DejaGnu proved to be insufficiently portable, and too
flaky. Two commands have been added to make it possible to write all
the tests in Lisp, namely execute-kbd-macro and insert-char. The
--script flag is now --load, which is what it really does. Various
commands have been made to work non-interactively. Duplication has
been reduced by generating much of the documentation from the code.
The info manual, which was not particularly useful and only duplicated
information available elsewhere, has been removed. Other small fixes
and improvements have been made.

Release 2.3.0:

This release continues the code cleanup and portability fixes started
in 2.2.60. gnulib is now used extensively, and 2,000 lines of code, or
about 20% of the code base, has been removed by refactoring,
simplification, and use of gnulib. The new minor version number
reflects the magnitude of the change.

To try to limit the number of bugs introduced as a result, and to aid
future maintenance, a DejaGnu test suite has been added, which tests
almost all the interactive commands.

Many small bugs have been fixed, including cases where Zile did not
behave like Emacs; some small limitations of Zile with respect to
Emacs have been removed.

Users are for the most part encouraged to upgrade, as this release is
believed to be stable; however, cautious users may want to wait for
further 2.3.x releases, or for a suitable length of time to elapse.

Release 2.2.61:

This release uses gnulib for regex, getopt, vasprintf, and various
other features, rather than previous ad hoc solutions, to improve
portability.

Release 2.2.60:

This release attempts to improve portability by using gnulib for
various non-standard features instead of idiosyncratic code and making
various other fixes. Thanks to Nelson Beebe for reporting many build
problems on a wide range of platforms; unfortunately I've not been
able to establish how many of them this release fixes. A crash and
related bug on attempting to kill when mark and point are the same
have been fixed. Some fatal error messages have been improved.

Release 2.2.59:

This release fixes various problems with release 2.2.58, including
shipping the wrong source code (oops), and automates the GNU release
process so that errors of this sort should no longer happen. The build
system was tidied a little.

Release 2.2.58:

This release makes Zile's transition to being a GNU program. Note the
new web site, distribution URL and support addresses. This release
also fixes the display of errors that occur during startup.

Release 2.2.57:

This release changes the code to meet GNU coding standards. It's not
recommended for users because there are no (intended!) functional
changes whatsoever, and it's just possible that new bugs have been
introduced.

Release 2.2.56:

This release fixes a bug that prevented top-bit-set characters being
bindable to commands.

Release 2.2.55:

This release allows Zile to produce core dumps when it crashes,
handles SIGBUS, and fixes a crash caused by trying to bind a command
to the empty string.
