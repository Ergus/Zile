1. General questions

1.1. What does `Zile' mean?

    It stands for `Zile Is Lossy Emacs'. It is just another recursive
    acronym like GNU.

1.2. What is Zile's license?

    Zile is released under the GNU General Public License. For more
    information, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html.

1.3. Why another clone of Emacs? Why not just use Emacs?

    From the features list in the Info documentation:

	``Small but fast and powerful. It is very useful for small
	footprint installations (e.g. on floppy disk) or quick editing
	sessions.''

    That's why sometimes Emacs isn't the best editor to use :-)  I
    use XEmacs myself when I do coding, but I use Zile when I have,
    let's say, to quick edit the dot files in the home directory; I
    don't want to wait 5 seconds to load XEmacs for doing a 2-second
    edit...

1.4. Where can I get the latest version?

    The Zile project is hosted on SourceForge at:

	http://zile.sourceforge.net/

1.5. Why did you choose such difficult key sequences?

    To be the same as Emacs.

1.6. Zile has a bug!

    Bug reports can be sent to the developers at
    <zile-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>, or entered directly into
    Bugzilla at http://sourceforge.net/projects/zile. Patches are
    appreciated.

1.7. I like the xyz function of (X)Emacs but it's not in Zile!

    Zile was written to be small but fast and powerful enough.

    In general, if you need something more powerful, use Emacs or
    XEmacs. You could also try Jed, which emulates Emacs, is not much
    bigger than Zile, and has syntax highlighting, a macro language
    and more (http://www.jedsoft.org/jed/).

    If you still think that a certain function should be implemented
    in Zile, please send a message to the developers (see question
    1.6).

1.8. How small does Zile get?

    On Debian 3.1 i386, Zile 2.0beta8 built with gcc 3.3.5 -O2 weighs
    in at 101,496 bytes when stripped. This is a fairly typical build.

1.9. Does Zile support Unicode/UTF-8?

    No. Support for Unicode is planned in the future.

1.10. Zile doesn't compile.

    We have tested Zile under GNU/Linux only (other than the EPOC
    port), although it should work on any POSIX-compliant OS that
    supports termcap or Allegro. If you get Zile running under an OS
    not listed here, please send a message to the Zile developers
    telling them that (you might also send any patches you have made
    to the Zile sources if you want them included in the next
    release).

2. Functionality

2.1. How do I quit Zile?

    Type `C-x C-c' (that means holding CONTROL while typing X,
    releasing them, then holding CONTROL while typing C)

2.2. How do I return to the shell without leaving Zile?

    Type `C-x C-z' or simply `C-z'.

2.3. Zile is hung.

    From the tutorial (`C-h t'):

    If Zile gets into an infinite (or simply very long) computation
    which you don't want to finish, you can stop it safely by typing
    `C-g'. You can also use `C-g' to discard a numeric argument or the
    beginning of a command that you don't want to finish.

2.4. How do I undo the previous command?

    Type `C-x u'.

2.5. What does `C-something' or `M-something' mean?

    From the tutorial (`C-h t'):

    C-<chr> means hold the CONTROL key while typing the character
	     <chr> Thus, `C-f' would be: hold the CONTROL key and type
	     `f'.
    M-<chr> means hold the META or EDIT or ALT key down while typing
	     <chr>. If there is no META, EDIT or ALT key, instead
	     press and release the ESC key and then type <chr>. We
	     write <ESC> for the ESC key.

2.6. What settings can I change?

    Check out the `dotzile.sample' file (type `C-h s') for a full list
    of variables.

2.7. How do I display non-ASCII characters?

    Zile uses the operating system's locale support, so you need to
    set an appropriate locale; how you do this depends on your OS.
    However, Zile only works with 8-bit locales at present; support
    for Unicode is planned.

2.8. Zile doesn't handle filenames containing non-ASCII characters.

    See the answer to question 2.7.

2.9. The `C-h' key is bound to <BS>/<DEL>; help doesn't work.

    Add the following line to your `~/.zile' file:

	(setq alternative-bindings true)

    and use the alternative key sequences (`M-h' instead of `C-h').

2.10. How do I enable auto-fill mode at startup?

    Add the following line to your `~/.zile' file:

	(setq auto-fill-mode true)
