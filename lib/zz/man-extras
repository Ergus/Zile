[description]
Zz is a lightweight text editor descended from GNU Zile's zmacs.
It has functionality suitable for basic editing. Compared to
zmacs, the Lisp Evaluator has been removed in favour of direct
evaluation in the source language, Lua - with which it is easily
extended and customized.

of memory.
