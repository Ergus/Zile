                        Reporting bugs in Zile
                        ----------------------

Bug reports, feature requests and patches should be sent to
<bug-zile@gnu.org>, or, preferably, filed directly in the relevant
tracker at http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/zile/

Zile has a suite of Lisp tests in the lisp-tests directory of the
source distribution. If when you report a bug you can create a similar
test that triggers it, the maintainers will be most grateful.
