                        Reporting bugs in Zile
                        ----------------------

Bug reports should be sent to <bug-zile@gnu.org>. Savannah users are
welcome to file bug reports, feature requests and patches directly in
the relevant tracker at http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/zile/

Zile has a testsuite (built using DejaGnu) of interactive tests. If
you can create a test that shows the problem, the maintainers will be
most grateful. To do this, you need to build Zile from source (it's
best to check out the git master branch if you can; otherwise, use the
latest release; see INSTALL for building instructions). You must also
install expect, and, in particular, the autoexpect script. Then, from
the top-level directory execute the commands:

    cd src/testsuite/zile.test
    ./make-interactive-test TEST_NAME

This will start Zile under expect's control on a sample file. Perform
the steps needed to reproduce the bug, then quit. This will write two
files, TEST_NAME.output and TEST_NAME.exp. You will then need to
produce a file containing the expected output; the easy way should be
to perform the same actions in Emacs. Attaching those files to the bug
report should help to locate and fix the bug faster. If the supplied
input file, zile_test.input, cannot easily be used to demonstrate the
bug, information on why not would also be appreciated.
