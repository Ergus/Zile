Zile is another Emacs-clone.  Zile is a customizable, self-documenting
real-time, open-source display editor.  Zile was written to be as similar
as possible to Emacs; every Emacs user should feel at home with Zile.

Zile features:

 - Small but fast and powerful.  It is very useful for small footprint
   installations (like on floppy disk) or quick editing sessions.

 - 8-bit clean.  Zile can operate with binary files.

 - Looks like Emacs.  Most Zile key sequences and function names
   are identical to Emacs ones.

 - Multi buffer editing w/multi level undo.  Zile can open an
   infinite number of files and can record an infinite sequence of
   undo operations (limited only by the amount of free memory).

 - Multi window.  Zile can display multiple windows on the screen.

 - Killing, yanking and registers.  The typical killing, yanking and
   register features of Emacs are available under Zile.

 - Minibuffer completion.  Zile can complete the user written text.
   This is very useful for `M-x' commands and for selecting files.

 - Colors.  Zile makes use of the color capatibilities of the
   terminal if available.

 - Source highlighting (C, C++, C#, Java, shell scripts, mails).
   Zile can highlight source files and scripts for better reading.

 - Auto fill (word wrap).  Zile automatically breaks the lines when
   they become too wide (if the Auto Fill Mode is enabled).

The Zile editor is written entirely in "C" with the help of the ncurses
library.  Zile can't be compiled with a library different than ncurses.  It
has been tested under Linux only, but it should be fairly simple
to port it under other operating systems, since it is written in ANSI C.
