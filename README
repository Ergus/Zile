                               GNU Zile
                               --------

GNU Zile (Zile Is Lossy Emacs) is a lightweight Emacs clone. Every
Emacs user should feel at home with Zile. Zile is aimed at small
footprint systems (FIXME: add typical memory consumption here) and
quick editing sessions (it starts up and shuts down instantly).

Zile is written in Lua 5.1 using POSIX.1-2001 APIs, and hence requires
only an ISO C 90 compiler and POSIX.1-2001 runtime.

Zile is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
