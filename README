                               GNU Zile
                               --------

GNU Zile (Zile Is Lossy Emacs) is a lightweight Emacs clone. Every
Emacs user should feel at home with Zile. Zile is aimed at small
footprint systems (a typical binary is about 100Kb) and quick editing
sessions (it starts up and shuts down instantly).

Zile is written in ISO C89 using POSIX APIs; its only external
dependency is ncurses.

Zile is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
