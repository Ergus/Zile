Zile (Zile Is Lossy Emacs) is a lightweight Emacs clone. Every Emacs
user should feel at home with Zile. Zile is aimed at small footprint
systems (a typical binary is about 100Kb) and quick editing sessions
(it starts up and shuts down instantly).

Zile is written in C; its only external dependency is a terminal
library, either termcap or allegro.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
