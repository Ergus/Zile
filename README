                               GNU Zile
                               --------

GNU Zile (Zile Is Lossy Emacs) is a lightweight Emacs clone. Every
Emacs user should feel at home with Zile. Zile is aimed at small
footprint systems (FIXME: add typical memory consumption here) and
quick editing sessions (it starts up and shuts down instantly).

Zile is written in Lua 5.1 using POSIX.1-2001 APIs, and hence requires
only a Lua 5.1 runtime and a few additional Lua modules:

   luabitop  >= 1.0.0  (http://bitop.luajit.org/)
   lrexlib   >= 2.5.0  (http://luaforge.net/projects/lrexlib)
   lcurses   >= 4      (http://luaforge.net/projects/lcurses)
   luaposix  >= 5.1.11 (http://luaforge.net/projects/luaposix)

Zile is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL.
